# Snake And Ladder

This is a Snake and Ladder game written in JavaScript. Any number of players can be added. And each player rolls a single dice on his / her turn.

The idea and initial code was written during the [CodeJugalbandhi](http://codejugalbandi.org/) at [Functional Conf 2015, Bangalore, India](http://functionalconf.com/). This is a fairly revised version of the code.

Take a look at how the board is initialized [here](https://github.com/swaroopsm/snake-and-ladder/blob/master/app.js).
